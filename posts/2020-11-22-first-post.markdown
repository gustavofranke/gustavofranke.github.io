First post
---------
Ok, so I’ve decided to setup this blog, I’m not sure how often I will be able to post, or about what the content will be.
Because I like Functional Programming I would imagine that it will be about that. And because its body of knowledge is scattered around books, talks, papers, blog posts, podcasts,  I think the content will be about how I manage to organise it in my head.

I’m certainly happy with this setup I’ve been playing with for a couple of days now: Hakyll on GitHub pages.
Setting it up was quite pleasant, so I’m thankful for that.

So, I hope you enjoy reading my blog!
