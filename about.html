            <h1>About</h1>
            <p>Hi! I’m Gustavo and I love writing software.</p>
<p>In the early 90s when I was about 9 years old, I was fortunate enough to have access to computers and I did a little bit of Logo (an educational programming language for kids).</p>
<p>Once in college (that was a long time ago) I did Pascal, C/C++, Smalltalk, Lisp and Prolog.</p>
<p>Back then, one thing that left an impression on me, was when I was exposed to the assignment operator, I found it strange that you could change the content of a stored value just for giggles.</p>
<p>During the days when I started writing code professionally, there was a big demand for Java programmers, and so, I learnt Java, and with that, H*b*rn*t*, Spr*ng, GoF Design Patterns and more.</p>
<p>Then Hadoop became in vogue, and I read that these ideas came from FP! And I used to love my Lisp back in college! Around those years, a lot of JVM languages stated to emerge, Clojure among them.</p>
<p>And so, I played at home with it, and also watched a lot of talks about it. Over the last few years I’ve been professionally writing mostly Scala, but always keeping an eye on what was going on with the Haskell world.</p>
